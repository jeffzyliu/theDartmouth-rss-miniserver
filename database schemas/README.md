# Database schemas

These are the SQL files I used to build the database. `schema.sql` is there to build a test database on MySQL localhost, and `herokuschema.sql` built the deployment database on ClearDB.

The `.mwb` file is a MySQL workbench Entity Relationship Diagram, which I used to plan out my schema and forward engineer to a database.
